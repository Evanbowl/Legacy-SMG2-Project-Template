# Legacy-SMG2-Project-Template
Aurum's SMG2 Project Template with some of the unused additions, ideas, and concepts returned.

This has the currently unused sources "PowerStarChanceBGM" and "SuperSpinDriverEmpty".

The /include directory isn't complete, and must be merged with the original Project Template's code.
https://github.com/SunakazeKun/SMG2-Project-Template

The ObjectData folder contains objects that are exclusive to this, and are not present in the original template.

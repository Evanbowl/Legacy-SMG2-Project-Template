# Legacy-SMG2-Project-Template
Aurum's SMG2 Project Template with some of the unused additions returned.

This has the currently unused source "AppearPowerStarBGM".
This is a hardcoded table that can be edited to remove the Star Chance BGM when a star spawns.

The /include directory isn't complete, and must be merged with the original Project Template's code.
